To add a CI/CD process to your NestJS Todo application using GitHub Actions, you need to create a workflow file in your project repository. This workflow will define the steps that GitHub Actions should take whenever a certain event occurs, such as pushing code to the main branch or creating a pull request.

Here's a step-by-step guide to set up a basic CI/CD workflow for your NestJS application:

1. In the root of your GitHub repository (`nest-todo-github-actions`), create a new directory called `.github/workflows` if it doesn't already exist.

2. Inside the `.github/workflows` directory, create a new file called `ci.yml` (or any name that makes sense for your workflow).

3. Define your CI/CD workflow in the `ci.yml` file. Below is a sample workflow that includes installing dependencies, running tests, and building the project.

```yaml
name: Continuous Integration and Deployment

# This workflow is triggered on pushes to the repository.
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build and Test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        name: Checkout code

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '16' # You can specify the Node.js version here

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run Linter
        run: npm run lint # Assumes there is a lint script in your package.json

      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test # Assumes there is a test script that runs your unit tests

      - name: Build Project
        run: npm run build # Assumes there is a build script in your package.json
```

4. If you have any secrets, such as API keys or environment variables that you want to use in your CI/CD process, you can add them to your repository's secrets in GitHub under Settings > Secrets.

5. Once you've added the `ci.yml` file to your `.github/workflows` directory and pushed these changes to your GitHub repository, GitHub Actions will automatically trigger the CI/CD pipeline based on the events you specified (`on: [push, pull_request]`).

6. Customize your workflow further to include additional steps like deployment to a hosting service or publishing Docker images if needed.

Remember to modify the provided example to fit into your actual application's requirements, such as installing additional dependencies or configuring a different test command.

If you want to include CD in this same `.yml` file, you would add another job after the build job, which could deploy to your desired hosting service. The specifics of this would depend on your hosting provider and might involve adding additional GitHub Action marketplace actions to your workflow.
